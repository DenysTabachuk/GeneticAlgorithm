# Genetic Algorithm Implementation

This project contains an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with its parallel versions, all written in Python.

The goal is to explore the optimization capabilities of genetic algorithms and improve performance by leveraging parallel processing.

## Features

- Basic Genetic Algorithm implementation
- Parallel versions using Python multiprocessing or other parallel libraries
- Easily extendable and customizable

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (if any) can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Instructions on how to run the code, examples, etc. (Add based on your project specifics)
